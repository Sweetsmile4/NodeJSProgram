Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript outside of a web browser, typically for server-side applications.

🌐 What Node.js Is
- Runtime Environment: Executes JavaScript code on the server, not just in the browser.
- Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
- Powered by V8: Uses Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for fast execution.
- Open Source: Free to use, with a large community and ecosystem.

⚙️ Key Features
- Event-driven & Non-blocking I/O: Handles many simultaneous connections efficiently, making it ideal for real-time apps.
- Scalable Applications: Designed for building fast, scalable network applications.
- npm (Node Package Manager): Comes with a huge library of modules to extend functionality.
- Server-side JavaScript: Enables developers to use JavaScript for backend development, not just frontend.

📌 Common Use Cases
- Web Servers & APIs: Build RESTful APIs and backend services.
- Real-time Applications: Chat apps, gaming platforms, collaboration tools.
- Data Streaming: Applications that process streams of data (e.g., video/audio).
- Command-line Tools: Automate tasks with custom scripts.
- Microservices: Lightweight services that communicate over APIs.

🔑 Example
Here’s a simple Node.js server:
// server.mjs
import { createServer } from 'node:http';

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});


This creates a basic HTTP server that responds with “Hello World!”.

⚠️ Challenges & Considerations
- Single-threaded: While efficient, CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop.
- Callback Hell: Complex nested callbacks can make code harder to maintain (though modern async/await helps).
- Not Always Best for Heavy Computation: Better suited for I/O-heavy applications.
